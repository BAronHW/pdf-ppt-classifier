    "# PDF Classifier Project Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Project Overview\n",
    "This project aims to create a classifier that can distinguish between PDF documents and PowerPoint presentations converted to PDF format. The classifier uses machine learning techniques to analyze features extracted from PDF files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Data Splitting\n",
    "- Implemented an 80:20 train-test split\n",
    "- Ensured proportional representation of both classes in each split\n",
    "- Used `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split` with `stratify` parameter\n",
    "- Used stratify to make sure that there is proportional representation of data in both splits\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Feature Extraction\n",
    "- Extracted average RGB values for each PDF using a library called pymupdf\n",
    "- Initially wanted to add average page word count as a feature but then on visual inspection of the data saw that for both PDF and PPT data it was mainly just images therefore eh pymupdf library woul not actually be able to recognise the words in the document.\n",
    "- Normalized the average RGB values to be between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Model Selection and Training\n",
    "- Chose Support Vector Model \n",
    "- Initially was thinking of either Support Vector Model or Logistic regression\n",
    "- Decided to go with SVM because of effectiveness with high dimentional spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Model Training\n",
    "- Implemented hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Model Evaluation\n",
    "- Accuracy: 0.73\n",
    "- F1 Score:\n",
    "  - PDF files: 0.79\n",
    "  - PowerPoint files: 0.64\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Visualization\n",
    "- Created confusion matrix using seaborn heatmap which can be found in the directory\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Possible Improvements\n",
    "- If I were to make any improvements I would create a more extensive feature extraction function\n",
    "- Possibly would extract details about texture and edge detection\n",
    "- I would have possibly used techniques I learned in university such as canny edge detection to see if it would improve the prediction of the SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. How to use the program\n",
    "- Within the classify_pdf.py program in the pdf_classifier directory there is a variable called `test_pdf_path` which you can change to any other path of .pdf file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you for this opportunity and I am looking forward to hearing back from you. \n",
    "\n",
    "## IMPORANT NOTE\n",
    "- For some reason the library pymupdf will give this error: \"MuPDF error: argument error: cannot create appearance stream for widgets\"\n",
    "- You can ignore this error and the program  will run fine as long as you let it keep running.\n",
    "\n",
